I see the sun
I'm on the Wocky and the X
I really came on this bitch to talk my shit
In the middle of the mall, we pull an all nighterÂ ( pinkgrillz)


I got, hundred racks, bands on me
In a GLE, AMG, yeah, ayy (Slide)
Ridin' around in the coupe with my brother, we pull up with two, we gon' shoot 'em for fun (Skrt, ooh)
Yeah, I like going insane (Ooh, ooh)
I like money, dollar signs, yeah (Ooh, ooh)
I like breaking them and getting high (Yeah)
I like taking X every morning and night (Let's go, yeah)
You know I'm addicted to X, I pop all of this late (Ah)
You know I'm addicted to Perc, but I try my best, yeah (I try)
This bitch addicted to the sex ah
Ah, ah (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


I was down on my ass, I had no help up (Ack)
I was down at the bottom and nobody helped me up, not a handout or nah, I ain't get no help
I fell asleep in the Jeep and I damn near crashed it (Swerve, woo)
Bitch, I've been geeked for a week and it's so fantastic (Huh, why?)
Really, it's really been months, but I don't want to talk about it (Really, ya)

They said I'd never do it, but I do what I please
