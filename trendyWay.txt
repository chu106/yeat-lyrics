Yeah, do this shit the trendy wayÂ 




First my money twerk, now it's lifting weights
Money in the gym, now it's heavyweight




They turn up once a year, turn up every day
Yeah, all type of diamonds, I got every carat
We got all types of lines, Tose' strawberry




Don't tell me you fucking with the mob, shit get too scary
Yeah, this Perky got me snail, you should call me Gary






Yeah, give a fuck 'bout what you said, don't need no commentary
Put some diamonds in my teeth, call the tooth fairy
Different pointers every week
I just came from Neiman's, I put Diors on my feet (Cost me fourteen)




I don't stress, my money woke up blessed
Yeah, I would cry too if the Wock' I got was stretched (I would cry)




You don't gotta tell me about this shit, I'm not impressed
Yeah, I just wake up, take a Perc', then take an X




Do that shit again, turn a five to a ten
I don't know who the fuck you is, I'm definitely not your friend
I just had to point it out like the top of a tent
I took all my Rollies out, think I counted 'bout ten
Yeah, okay, I woke up at seven PM for breakfast




And if that bitch's throat the GOAT, she get a necklace (With diamonds)
They said the way I'm living bad, it's way too reckless (Stop it)
This not Breaking Bad, but my brother selling methods




I pulled up, broke her back, then I asked her where her friends is
I spent Fashion Week in France, all my bitch pussy the wettest


Yeah, do this shit the trendy way 
First my money twerk, now it's lifting weights

We got all types of lines, Tose' strawberry




Don't tell me you fucking with the mob, shit get too scary

Yeat my fucking slime, mob ties, called up the fleet
TwizzyRich so up, we get richer every week




He thought he my twizzy, smoked him like a stizzy




Toseina got me dizzy, called my bitch to get some nizzy




That's that neck, I don't want no sex, I just need them Percs
A hundred milligrams, I just left the Earth






Yeah, do this shit the trendy way 
First my money twerk, now it's lifting weights
Money in the gym, now it's heavyweight




They turn up once a year, turn up every day




Yeah, all type of diamonds, I got every carat
