You could say I'm 'bout shit 'cause I do it all
Yeah
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, X ta C)


I'm in Neiman's, we gon' shut down the store, that's for sure




I've been vibed out, so my wave gon' hit the shore
All my Oxys on the table, this bitch just thought that shit was coke




Ask me what my lifestyle, I had to get up off the floor




Ask me why my life's over, bitch, I got up, gotta go
Gotta change your lifestyle, get that money and gotta go
All my twizzies know what time we on before we hit thе show




All my bizzies think I wifed 'em but I ain't goin' for shit




I got twizzy down thе road, and he got chickens like a store (Phew, phew, phew)




Oh my god, I left the studio running, shit could burn a home (Ah)
Five-percent tinted windows, I can't see this shit, I don't know




Gotta stack up all this money I ain't crazy like a ho
I feel like Lil Uzi, you heard what I said lil' bitch




I'm the rich one now, I left you on read lil' bitch




Yeah, and I'm booted off the drugs, I don't even feel like me
Shut up baby girl, I want them drugs, you really my ecstasy


I be so damn high and so paranoid, I don't need 'em next to me




Yeah I get this cash, but I don't know what really next to me
Since I'm next up, that bitch wan' steal my kids, vasectomy (Woah, fuck)




Fuck it, girl I'm really—, I know she wanna have sex with me
Upside down T (T), this the one that protecting me




When I was down bad, ain't no assisting me (Yeah)
Vlone shit is lame as fuck, I been just rocking the Telfar tee
Unless that Vlone on that Forgiato, that shit a specialty




Wake up when it's 1 AM, get active, that's my recipe (Go, go, go)






Yeah, you gotta leave, you gotta leave, you gotta leave, you gotta leave (Yeah, yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta leave, you gotta leave (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, turn up)
