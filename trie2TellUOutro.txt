Yes, I got the X with the woah-oah
She say she wan' get back (She gon' woah-oah)
She say she wan' pull up on the-
She say she wan'-
Ah


It feel like an overdose is creeping up on me
My face is numb, I can't feel nothin' but the numbing
I walked out the stu' to get some air then walked in the hallway
Feelin' deep but, but I need me everything
Yeah, overdose, yeah, overdose, yeah, overdose, yeah, overdose
How could the hell you think you didn't wanna put trust in thе kid?
Everywhere shе creepin', won't put trust up in the kid
I'm feeling way too gone, I'm feeling too fucked up
All my pockets doubled up, I walked in, I leveled up
Way too tapped with all my twizzys, said we way too up
Feelin' way too gone
I been in the sky, we humans, we gon' cry
No, you not that guy, no, you not that fly
I don't know why you try (Ah)


Every time I
Time I- Yeah
Every time I try something
Every time I buy something
Every time I 
You make me glow
Bitch, finna make me show up
Time I'm finna go up (GOONTEX)




Fuck, I'm tired of counting these bands in the mornin'
Tired of go and ran it up this much, I ain't do nothing, I ain't try once
Every weekend, bitch, I hit Chanelly then I hit Balenci', you can't have nothin'
I learned to finesse with the bank then I got all my money invested and doubled up
I feel way too stuck, I'ma get all this money and run it up
Lately, I feel too fucked up, finna take me break on the X but I can't, nah
I am addicted but how could I change when everything going right now feel so damn good?
(I know that you waiting)
