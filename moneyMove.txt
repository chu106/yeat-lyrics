Go 'head, O
Danny, I see you


On some cash, what I'm running through
Bands, make that money move
Dance, make that honey groove
Pussy tastes like honeydew
With these racks I see straight through you
You thought that shit was make believe
All this guap I got on me, it make these bitches want to see


Hold up
Diamonds flooded on my ring, check
I got money for my team
Women is so delicious
Swimming in different bitches
I'ma get
Audemar on my wrist
Got a new bitch, suck dick
Autopilot in a spaceship
Bad lil' baby, can you face it?
Hop in the Tesla, I put it in coupe

What the hеll did I do to you?
Why can't you just keep it real, keep the truth?
Yuh


Keeping it the truth, yuh (Keeping it)
Keeping it truе, yuh (Keeping it keep-)
Keeping it true, yuh (Keeping it true)
Keeping it true, yuh (Yeah)
Huh, yuh, yuh
Keeping it true with me (Keeping it keeping it)
Keeping it true with me (True)
Too many holes in my jeans




On some cash, what I'm running through
Bands, make that money move
Dance, make that honey groove
Pussy tastes like honeydew
With these racks, I see straight through you (Yeah)
You thought that shit was make believe
All this guap I got on me, it make these bitches want to see (Yeah, yeah)
