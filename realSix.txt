Yeah, all of my brothers is rich and rockin' that Chrome Hearts




Yeah, all of my thots they love me, they bang my phone
Six shots, dead
I been on pills all day, MIA




I pull up, we turn that boy nauteous, we turning it sick
Ride 'round that bitch with a, yeah, blick
Took me the ecstasy, I'm high, can't even see
And this chain so heavy, I'ma die, Glock sit on my hip (Say)
I'm driving around the city, and I pull to the VIP
It be your own city that'll kill you, like R.I.P. Nip




I went and been spent like a fire, I bought me the ship
Yeah, I'm chillin' up at the Ritz, so that they call me Chip




Pour a four up in my soda just so I could dip
Walk inside the building, posted on my hip
I told you to back away, I don't need none of your help
My wrist livin' undеrwater, might as well call this kelp




Six shots, dеad
I been on pills all day, M.I.A
Like a Trump man, could bleed your head




Every last one of my bitches love on me (I know that you do)
And I hate to say it, but I'm horny
And I need you to lick on all of me (Baby)


I went and put my wrist on no degree (Yeah)
I went and put my rich on with no degrees (What?)




Bitch, I died and didn't go to Heaven
All my pockets really filled up with some knots, yeah, bitch, they really breaded




Any time I ever told you I was talkin' shit, better know I really meant it
I can't even waste my time with a broke bitch, nah, she can't spend a penny
Got a lot of Percs, it ain't hard to pen it, yeah (Yeah)
Got a lot of Percs, got a lot depending on me (What?)
I just left the Earth and they told me landed on me
I just told her pull up, come and break it down on me
How the hell you pull up, then go turn around on me?


Yeah, all of my brothers is rich and rockin' that Chrome Hearts
Yeah, all of my thots they love me, they bang my phone
Six shots, dead

I pull up, we turn up a notch, we turning it sick
Ride 'round that bitch with a, yeah, blick
