(Let's go) I just walked up into Saks Fifth




Bitch, you broke, you just act rich (Yeah)
I got bread like a sandwich
Oxy' got me sleeping, I took an Addy




And my twizzy in the kitchen like that boy Paula Deen (Yeah, yeah)




If you don't fuck with the vision then unfollow me (Yeah, yeah)
Racks way too fat, watch 'em stack, they as tall me (Yeah, yeah)
And your bitch call me her dad, she want a bag, she give her all to me
I just took the Tesla, not the car




Yeah, that shit in the garage, it had to charge
And bitch, I been that same kid since the start
If you switch up on the gang, you won't make it far
I don't reply to tеxts, I be icy
Just want S-E-X when I'm on that O-X-Y






Play my set likе a PS5 (Yeah, yeah)
Got pressure, got PSI
Brand new diamonds I got from Eliantte, they got pee inside 'em




Yeah, I just been geeked up, yeah, for a year I been silent
Yeah, couldn't call up my label a year ago, shit was so silent
Now they calling me back like, "Yeat, we wanna sign you" (Fuck 'em)




Yeah, I don't even need no bread, I got every designer
Call my twin my twizzy, call my bitch my bizzy
Might just smoke this stizzy, and this Oxy' got me dizzy
Draco, it hold fifty, keep that here, no injury
Drank bad for my kidney but I'm still sipping Trissy (And Wock')
Walked in with fifty thousand bitch, sipping like literally
Walked in with shit that's unreleased, it came from Italy
I laugh when these kids flex, they just look like a mini me
You can't check up on the things I did, I swear I got no history
I ain't letting up the gas all year, I give 'em misery
And I got a lot of fans, but at the top is where they picture me (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I fell in love with that Oxy', that bitch a kid to me (Yeah, yeah)
"No, I want the opposite," she told me, "Put your kids in me" (Yeah, yeah)
