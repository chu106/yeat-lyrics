Racks out
Yes, I went to sleep when I brung my racks out
Yes, I went to sleep and then I brung my racks out
I was sleepwalking around my house, pulling it all out






Let me tell you how my night went
Tell you how my night went
First thing I did was take some X to make it vibrant
Second thing I did was pour a three of Wock' to slide in
And the last thing I did was take a fifth to the head, we flying
Now you know the recipe, a bean help you get high, man


Now, I always wanted to fly, sometimes I want to be gliding
I already know you want to die, if he slide, that boy dropping
They asked me what car I'm driving, I said the Cayenne
I'm sliding, before I slid to Miami, the high-end
Dealership
Copped it, the brand new, I'm sliding in it
The Z06, yeah
I ain't go to sleep in so many damn days, I think I'm sleepwalking
I been in the stu' for so many days, I think I'm sleeptalking
Ask me if I wanna do some shit, said "Nah, hell, nah, don't need talking"
Bitch, was sucking the dick so long, she woke up with a knee problem
I been sober way too long, know this E calling
Called up Eliantte, told him all my diamonds need V on it
Stand on my money, 6'11" like I'm Giannis




Call my dresser a toilet 'cause it got so many P's on it


Go, yeah (Brr)
Go, yeah


Racks out
Yes, I went to sleep when I brought my racks out
Yes, I went to sleep and then I brung my racks out
I was sleepwalking around my house, pulling it all out



Let me tell you how my night went
