Big body GLE-ski, I went bought it (Oh, na-na-na)
My diamonds real pissy, they potty (Hey, hey)




I'm finna pull up in Benz, no Audi
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we don't know nobody
Twenty bad bitches, they all in the lobby
Getting rich just like this is a hobby (Ayy)
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body, big body, big body
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body, big body, big body, big body, big body




If everybody could get lit just like this, then they would and they wouldn't even tell nothin' about it (Ayy)
Say it again for the kids that just doubted
Walked in YSL, then left with a closet
I was cleanin' up, yeah, I call that scrubbin'
I made her cut ties with her buddy
Go 'head, chop 'em up like Paul Bunyan




Let it go, let it bang


I'm as high as a cranе
I be chillin' with the demons
Off thе Perc', I can't walk at all, paraplegic
Leanin' sideways off the drank, got me geekin'
They don't be high, don't be knowin' the minute (Uh)
666, 777, drink it




I ain't took a break from the Percs in a long time (Uh)
Tell this bitch I need the bread, need the long time
I ain't never pull a goddamn loan out
Bitch turn me on when I'm pulling out my bone out
Walk inside that bitch, we don't do no scuffle
Makin' money off the Perc', I'ma shuffle (Shuffle)
Dig it up and bury back like a shovel
I don't know what's going on, in a bubble (Ah)
I don't know what's going on in the world
Fucking hate the cops, we always in trouble (Woo)
I don't pay attention to shit but my gang and my money and I don't wanna know about it
I be geeked, I take a Tes' in the Tesla




I be geeked, I take a crank in the morning
You ain't geekin' boy, your life is a lie




How you know all that shit? You a spy
Heard you snitchin', you a bug, you a fly
I just woke up, got the Tonka, and go ride it
I been geekin' up a lot, I won't lie
I been starting to think I'm losing my mind
But the devil told me everything fine
I just woke up, fucked that bitch in her spine
I don't be doin' shit on the online
I just be bootin' up out of my mind
Copped a double, then I tripled it down
Bitch, I don't want nothin', don't wait in no line
Hold up, triple seven
Park that bitch back like I'm double heaven
Hold up, triple deuces
Pour this bitch up, we got all the juices (Drank)




Hold up, speak to heaven
Geeked up out my mind, might need me a medic



Big body GLE-ski, I went bought it (Oh, na-na-na)
My diamonds real pissy, they potty (Hey, hey)
I'm finna pull up in Benz, no Audi
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we don't know nobody
Twenty bad bitches, they all in the lobby
Getting rich just like this is a hobby (Ayy)
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body, big body, big body
Pull off in a Tonka, yeah, this a big body, big body, big body, big body, big body
If everybody could get lit just like this, then they would and they wouldn't even tell nothin' about it (Ayy)
