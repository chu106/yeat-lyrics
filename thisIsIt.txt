Lil' Kodak think it's me (Me, me, me)

Man, it feel like a girl world (Yeah), all on me, yeah
Push that start, I ain't using no key (Skrrt, skrrt)
Mr. Crank, gotta keep it lowkey (Lowkey)
Man, I put the gas in y'all E
I need some bread, need a wheat (Yeah)
Off some molly, you know that I'm geeked (I'm geeked)

I walked in and dropped me a bag on my feet
My family the east, so you know that we beasts
