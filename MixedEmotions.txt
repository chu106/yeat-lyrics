Hoe, let's get it, oh
Hoe, let-, yeah


Hoe, let's get it, hoe (Hoe)
Hoe, let's get it, hoe (Woah, woah)
Hoe, let's get it, oh (Oh)
Oh, let's get it (Hoe, let's get it)
All I smoke is strong, not no midget (Oh)
They turn my music on, nah, I can't handle more crickets, no
I sat in the back with a bag full of racks
Y'all smokin' on mini-me, yeah, they cancer
My diamonds, they jumpin', they flyin' like (Hoe)
Ask me a question, no, it's not no answer (Yeah)
Hеr ass so fat, it's like a 
Boy, you a baby, just put on your Pamper
We got thе voice and it's always be lit like a candle
I know you can't handle


I got the guap and my bands up
I mix the Goyard with the big body truck (Skrrt)
I pop me a Tesla, now it's really up
They would just suck on us, now it's just up
A whole lotta money, that's what I deserve
I told 'em I'm mad and it's fuck what you heard
I came for the bag, I know this shit hurt
You can't steal my swag, yeah, it's not from Earth
I got a ten on the whip
Yeah, I got a bet on the win (Hold on)
They just wanna suck this dick (Hold on)

Perc, I'm feelin' this shit
Yeah, this penthouse the shit
I'm high as fuck like the sky and the blimp
Just talked with my bro, told him send me the zip
I'm very elegant, I'm rockin' silk
I cummed in her mouth and she thought it was milk
, but what is the deal?
I think for myself, I don't care how you feel
I'm so high, I don't know if this shit is real
I think it's the time that I crack me a seal
I slip it up just like a banana peel
I know you so fake 
Laid it in cash, with a rack in the hills
Jumpin', hold it, like Jumpman
Throw the ball, no pump fake
Now my wrist on 
I run the bag, I'm not goin' out sad
You heard what I said, no mistake what I say
 focus, I'm always on plays
Rockin' the silk like a muhfuckin' 
 in the hills like a 
I broke my new phone so I'm getting a case
I talk how I live and I do what I say
The gang goin' up, so you run out of space
A hunnid bands, yeah, what I made today, you know that you broke and you didn't make shit today
I know that I'm scorin' that guap 'cause I'm stackin' my chips on my wrist, yeah, my Frito Lays, huh?



Hoe, let's get it, hoe (Hoe)
Hoe, let's get it, hoe (Woah, woah)
Hoe, let's get it, oh (Oh)
Oh, let's get it (Hoe, let's get it)
