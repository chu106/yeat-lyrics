Rockin it, rockin it Rockin it


Rock on it, roll Rockin it, rockin it Rockin it, rockin it Her body I’m rockin it Lean with a rock in it Rockin it, rockin it Started to poppin shit Rock on it, roll I got a 30, I’m poppin it, poppin it, cut the edge off of it Inside her esophagus No I’m not stopping it, no I’m not stopping it Imma keep rockin it

I’m in the hill with a fast car, a nascar I need some pills, applying the pressure Okay this shit got real, you not in the field I got me a bag, come cash, some bills I couldn’t answer the ph-, yeah they call me later You find I don’t really know if I love her or hate her I’m slow, 2 pills, oh gone Who knows, love kills I won’t love on this bitch Yeah I’m bouta bone I’m never wrong off a throne Stop calling my phone, calling my phone I’m in my zone, smoking on weed, strong I’m extravagant, what is happening? Why I’m rapping this? She a We fuck off the molly I got some more in supply, I’m not crashing yet She sucking my blood, call her Count Dracula I need me a not using I thought we was boning, what got into ya? Remember them days, early in the studio Remember them days didn’t eat Remember them days, balling like a kid again I got many racks, are you kidding me? See that they envy, they laugh, they pity me Wonder why nobody makes it really All of you broke, it’s sad

Rock on it, roll Rockin it, rockin it Rockin it, rockin it Her body I’m rockin it Lean with a rock in it Rockin it, rockin it Started to poppin shit Rock on it, roll I got a 30, I’m poppin it, poppin it, cut the edge off of it Inside her esophagus No I’m not stopping it, no I’m not stopping it Imma keep rockin it
