These Perkies, they don't stop, I can't feel enough, yeah I was pullin' up in that big body lil' Bentley truck




I was ridin' round with a cup full of that dirty stuff
I got the whole world rockin' with me, bitch, it's stuck as fuck
Pulled up in a lil' (Skrrt)
Pulled up in a big Tonka (Damn)
I just be leaving the Earth, I mix the bean with the Perc'
I used to go boot off the molly all day, now it don't even work
I just pulled up in the big body GLE-ski, I'ma rip up the curb
Yeah, we gon' ride around town, luh geeky life, yeah, we gon' pull up and lurk
Yeah, and every bitch out here wan' pull up, you know that I'm murkin'
I wanna boot up, I know that I shouldn't (What? Hey, yeah)
I just be takin' these Percs 'bout to nod off (Yeah)
Ridin' round kickin' that bitch like this bitch Judo (Hey)
Every diamond on me is so flawless, it's extravagant
Walked inside the apartments we used to live in, huh, like never again
I can't even fuck with nobody, not once, not twice, not never again (Demons)
He thought we would only spin once, can't wait, I did it again
Pull up outside, luh crank, yeah, and I pulled out the Benz, yeah
I don't even fuck with nobody, yeah, I fucked her friends


Had to drop me a lil' classic album, yeah, I done did it again
Takin' the Perc' with the X, yeah, I don't feel my limbs
If I'm gon' rent the car, then I'm gon' scrape the rims
Yeah, my money fat like Buddha,



 your money slim like Jim
I'm riding in this Tonka, GLE
I just went and hit Neimans and I walked out with a few bags
I can't even rock with them no more, that's just a fact
When I'm out in London, I'm a yankee, you'll get stabbed




She asked me if I want the bitch on top of her, I said, "Yeah"
Pulled up and I chopped the helicopter, got the Scat
