Yeah 
Bitch not for me, she got that Pac-sun
No that shit all night, for me, she got a rack or sumn'
Pockets the size of a building, all this drip on me no Pac-a-sun


You don't have a lil' SRT, don't have a Hellcat, you lyin'
I don't even gotta do shit, I just wake up and get bread, I'm not tryin'
That's your old bitch, she say she love me, now so we up in the Cayenne
Finna go change my name to "Private Jet" how much I'm high flying
You can't say I won't go up, 'cause I'ma die tryin'
Got a brand new four-door Rolls-Royce Cullinan truck how I'm driving
Yeah, and that bitch gon' bounce on this dick like I got me hydraulics (Yuh)




I got the racks at the bottom myself, then I bought that again (Again)
Think I'm falling in love again (Yuh)
With Benjamin Franklin, I'm sorry ma'am
All this water that sit on me collect like Hoover Dam (Yuh)




In the strip club, no Madagascar, I like the way that she move it, yeah (Like she move it)




Yeah I gotta get it no option (Yuh), kid stop talking
Why you on my phone every day, every night, this shit is too exhausting




So Much Fun like Thug said



, no syrup and no Oxy, yeah, so awesome
Tired of these dudes serving them dogs all day
And my fingers blue, took a long time to get this way
Ain't nothin' like me, ain't high as me
Ain't nothin' like me, ain't high as me
Yeah I been through so much, don't nothin' surprise me (Nothin')
I had the diamonds all on myself so they see what I see (See)


I went and take this bitch out on a date, her name was oxy
Really I just try to sleep when I'm on the codeine, but I took me some molly
Know that this shit is not good for my health, I can't stop doing it, I'm sorry
Really just been too goated with this punchin' in shit, I feel like Ali




They in a different world than me, they do not see what I see
Gon' tell them to take a step back away from me, think they gon' judge me
We down bad, and this shit can get too ugly
Yeah that shit was sad, I could only afford to eat lunchmeat
They thought that I done fell off, boy, I came back like a bungee
She ask me what's a damn Trackhawk, I told her the best Jeep




I dont even fuck with nobody, said all my drugs is really my bestie
You gotta take it or leave it, I'm getting this bread now, I swear I'm investing
I'm finna miss these days when I was nothing, that was the best thing
I turned this shit outta nothing without assumption, you wouldn't text me
You was really always there for me, baby you just so sexy
Don't believe my lies, you know how I get whenever I'm texting
Yeah, yeah, or whenever I'm flexing
Shut your dumbass up, my brother got killed, this shit'll get messy
That's a Number Nine brand jeans on me, no I ain't rockin' no Guess
I'm not ridin' off this wave, yeah I just gotta do my best
I get so high all the time, that's why I don't ever stress
Gotta stay down and get right, my people I gotta impress (Yuh)
They wouldn't think I could do this shit, so I go out and flex


That's your old bitch, she say she love me, now so we up in the Cayenne
Finna go change my name to "Private Jet" how much I'm high flying
