Fell in love with easter pink




That's that good shit, on my man
Popped a perc' can't even think




This shit still feeling like a dream
I scammed myself with diamond rings
Dropped fifteen-hunnid on my feet
That's what got these diamonds dancing
My bitch a thriller, yeah, like Michael Jackson
This shit get realer why the hell you asking?
My drip a boat, I guess I am the captain
Why you bo'? Why you always capping?


I'm all by myself
I smoke this weed all by myself
They ain't like the kid they slime me up put me on the shelf
They don't like the kid I know they hating, I could tell
H-H-Hate is overrated, money made me how I am
I do what I want, and I see you do what you can
This perc' 10 beat my ass, nah, I don't fuck with xans, nah
They wanna fuck my shit up, I can't even give 'em a chance
I got bread, yeah, on my pocket, Got baguette on my ring from France
I swear to god that all of y'all lost it, don't care bout shit bout 'em bands
Your guys switched up on yo' ass for the bands, but you said that's your mans


I got, I got, racks, racks, racks, racks, racks, racks
I got racks, I got racks, racks, I got, racks
I got, I got racks, I got racks, racks
Hunnids, fifties, cash, racks
