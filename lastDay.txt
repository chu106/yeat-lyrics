It feels so good to be alive
Hope I don’t die
If I do, I'ma cry


Woke up feeling myself (Like it’s my last day alive)
Woke up feeling too good
Your bitch touching herself
Had to come try to help
They tryna say that I been on these drugs, it’s a cry for help (Yeah)

This lil' ol' broke bitch gotta be a shoe 'cause I won't converse
We on X everyday like they Starburst (Too geeked up)
She wanted to suck me up, will you do my cock first (Yeah, yeah)
These diamonds reflect light like this is Star Wars (Yah, yeah)
Bitch let me nut on her face, there’s nut all in her pores (Yeah)
You don’t really be geeked like me, I need me some award (Geeked up champion)
Used to be down bad broke, I was in a Honda Accord (Down)
Gotta stay down with my twizzy, we gotta play our part
I can’t love me this bizzy because I got a cold heart
Yeah, hey, hey, I got a cold heart
Yeah, in the back of the airport, Goyard
Throw it up, I won't miss like I'm Brett Favre (Yeah, hey hey)
