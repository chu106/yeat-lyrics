Outside (Uh), yeah
Pullin' up in Tonkas, bitch, we learned just how to finesse (Uh)




Big body, got the big Tonk (Tonka)
Turn this shit up, it's my song (Luh crank)
Half a Perky, I'm right in my zone
I'm shoppin' on the way back home (Go)
I'm puttin' on for the westside, so I'ma bust a nut on her chest




Hope you got bulletproof vests on, told 'em I'ma do it the best
Turn this shit up, my theme song, I might run out of gas
High as a tent with the beans on, bitch, I been way out of space
Yeah, lil' thottie, watch your tone
YSL, feel like cologne




Why you be callin' my— (Bitch)
I don't even mean by—
Rollie flooded (Flooded)
Diamonds flawless (Flawlеss)
Bad thotties
Big bodies (Skrrt, yeah)






Watch yoursеlf, told you that I want you, I don't need you (Yeah)
I could tell, you don't got no money, that shit see through (Ha)
Outside (Ayy, ayy)
I'm just outside, I'm just outside (Ayy)
Yeah, and we turn up (Ayy)
Flawless diamonds on me, bitch, my burners
I just called up all my twizzys, my brothers
Yeah, we had pulled up on your wifey, said they love us (Yeah)
No, no, you can't be no Twizzy Rich 'cause you don't know us




I just crank inside the Lamb', you not rich, you bogus
Racks, hey, yeah
Pullin' up in big old bodies with bands like it's parade




I can't trust a soul, can't trust nobody, but that's my way
I don't be going to sleep, I wake up at night and geek up all day
