 it’s so elegant I’m rocking the tee, it’s so elegant My money bigger than big like an elephant Yeah
I’m rocking the tee, it’s so elegant My money bigger than big like an elephant She eat the dick, in her mouth like a pelican Rock with the realest and none of us hesitant
So show me the president Once I get money, I won’t be depressed again Say what I mean, know what was happening Yeah, I’ll admit it, I live like a junkie
But I still did it, man, whole lotta money You wanna split it, I don’t find it funny Know I won’t quit it, she hot like a bunny I can’t fuck with nobody, they seem to be recording me
Copy my drip, it’s like I imported ’em , pour it up She too hot, feel like Florida I’m rocking the tee, it’s so elegant
My money bigger than big like an elephant She eat the dick, in her mouth like a pelican Rock with the realest and none of us hesitant So show me the president
Once I get money, I won’t be depressed again Say what I mean, know what was happening I’m rocking the tee, it’s so elegant My money bigger than big like an elephant
She eat the dick, in her mouth like a pelican Rock with the realest and none of us hesitant So show me the president Once I get money, I won’t be depressed again
Say what I mean, know what was happening
