Back in the day was a tweak
Look at me now, I’m a geek
Pull up suckin' D
And I just made this beat
When you pull up, don’t snitch (Shh)
I’ve been on molly for weeks

Yeah, only way I know is up, yeah (Uh, uh)
Let's go, pull up, she suck it, she eat
'Bout to get high, 'bout to geek (Let's go)
I’m in the stu' off a Addy (Too up)
I ain’t been around in a week
Bout to take a Perc', I ain’t sleep (Yeah)
Only like a bitch off the X (X)
Even then, I only want sex
I don't even think I’m depressed (No)
She say that she love me, she say, "I’m in love with you"




We don't know nobody in these Balenci shoes




You can’t talk that shit if you broke
How you gon' let that get to you?


I know while you broke that you not the same but that’s something a ho would do
And you gotta go get this bag, gotta go run it up, ain't nothing holding you
You say it’s not me no more, bitch, you just the same from the old you
I swear y’all just look at greatness and think somebody owe you
When I’m pissed off, I go get my racks
When I’m pissed off, I go hit the stash
And I'm pissy, I think that I taxed
Really just get in y'all wax
Your heart, I really just smashed
Different color diamonds, I mismatch (Which one do I...)
Oxy my drink when I’m sad
Yeah, I know a lot of y'all mad
Lot of y'all going out bad
Are you mad I got these racks
Are you mad I got this swag?
I’m in Neiman's, I'm popping these tags
I'm out of options, we getting these racks
And the top of this bitch is all ass
Yeah, and the bitch don't even brag
Yeah, I done got rich on they ass
I just went up a whole class
When you get like this, yeah, life really feel so good, I don't even have to scam
Yeah, I ain’t even at the top yet, I'm feeling to up with my hand


And I just made this beat
Back in the day was a tweak
Look at me now, I’m a geek (Let's go-go)
Pull up, suck it, yeah (Uh-uh, uh)



Yeah, only way I know is up, yeah
