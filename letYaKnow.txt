This could be my last song, ho




It feel like I'm dying on that X, ho
Yeah, I be taking Percs just for my head, ho




Had to let you know, I said woah
I just told you don't come in the door, I said go
I had to tell y'all, I had to let you know, you not my ho
I just take the Perc' and then I float




I pull up and I turn up, talking 'bout a, yeah, show
My money get taller every day, yeah, it grow
I know you been stalking my page, I know you lil' ho, I know


Yeah, I went and ran it up, I had enough
Went and switched the Benz, I had it scuffed
Yeah, you's a "pick me" on the low, I know your stuff
Yeah, you know, I call everyone, I call your bluff
Yeah, you know, you know the Tonka is my truck
Couldn't decide on thе Perc' or the X, I took 'em both




Wе just laughin' at your music, you a joke, yeah
These bitches jumpin' on me like some rope




I make the best songs when I'm dyin', I thought you knew




Yeah, you not my twizz, you not my twin, you not my bro, yeah




I just picked up on the side, I let it go
I just pulled up on your side, I'm in your ho, yeah
I just pulled up, made a mess and then I go
I'm richer than a bitch, I run the world
Now, go 'head, tell me what you said, what's the word?
Now, go 'head, pull up on the cops and hit the swerve
I tried to tell you everything, you wouldn't learn
I been one of the greatest to ever do it since my birth


This could be my last song, ho
It feel like I'm dying on that X, ho
Yeah, I be taking Percs just for my head, ho
Had to let you know, I said woah
I just told you don't come in the door, I said go
I had to tell y'all, I had to let you know, you not my ho
I just take the Perc' and then I float
I pull up and I turn up, talking 'bout a, yeah, show
My money get taller every day, yeah, it grow
I know you been stalking my page, I know you lil' ho, I know
