I don't give a fuck if you over there, especially if you was hating me
How the fuck am I this young and they critiquing me? (They critics)
I do whatever I want, I live so peacefully (So peaceful)
They said that I'm the president, they ain't impeaching me (They not though)
If I had to be political, they should teach with weed (I'm not no president)




Then they should go and delete some jobs, they should be geeked for weeks




That bitch said are you sure you wanna marry, I bought her a really ring (Really ring)
I hope you know that that's a lie, I would never do silly things

She said she wanted a Birkin bag, I told her, drink my kids
Only sipping on this lean, I don't sip out no fifth (Yeah)

Y'all go out broke, just sleep in your bed all day (How lazy)
I ain't even go to sleep yet, it's one o'clock, yeah, I took a Tesla

Most of these kids just broke, talk shit like peons
Why'd you take another Tesla? To feel like Elon
I'm finna ship out this weed but I don't even smoke no more, you gotta tell me if it's strong (Yeah)
I replaced another wrong I had with two wrongs
I'm so goddamn high, it look like this bitch got on two thongs
They told me the heavyweight champion, yeah, that I'm too strong
And I know I'm stressing 'bout this shit so I'm 'bout to move on

Only way I know how to sleep is with some Trissery (I ain't lying)



I told the doctor, it ain't no live in me (No lie)
