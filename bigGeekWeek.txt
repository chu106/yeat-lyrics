 Rack on me you know that they ain't did that
killed they , in they song, they ain't lived that
 kissing bitches all they got to do is kiss ass
Treat how you like it, I run the bag and I run it back again


Peanutbutter inside coupe it look like reese's




I'm a break down the molly into pieces
Put it inside of my Gatorade and get to geeking
Now I know I no-more fucking problem for the weekend


Tweakin all this molly from norwegian's I'm a call somebody
The way I kill this beat I kill this song I feel like columbine




I only see blue, I guess you could say I'm colorblind
I been working harder every day I think I know its mine


I'm in OT I'm in overtime
Do you need to take a little T
Do you need some time




Way I rhyme, where ya at
Out of town, smoking gas
By the pound, got big bags, large amounts
Now where he at yea find him out


I only know bitch I am so hot
It feel like I'm in the carpets, turn it bitch up, yea
Turn it to a moshpit, how we been flexing yea pull it like It's CrossFit


100 putting ass on my bag I want it rack-rack-rack
I got cash on my cash cuz I stare-stare-stare
I count in blues it give me a rash, yea its a rap-rap-rap
What would you do If you hidden nudes
You count it in blue, now it's Blue's Clues


I keep this guap on me, she taken my dead lottery
I get this guap on me, all these bitches want flock at me
All these kids they touching my swag, this shouldn't feel like a robbery
I did it one time, this is a verse cut back for me, yea


Rack on me you know that they ain't did that
killed they cap, in they song, they ain't lived that
kissing bitches all they got to do is kiss ass
how you like it, I run the bag and I run it back again


Peanutbutter inside coupe, it look like reese's
I'm a break down the molly into pieces
Put it inside of my Gatorade and get to geeking
Now I know I no-more fucking problem for the weekend


Yo yea yea
Yo yea yea
