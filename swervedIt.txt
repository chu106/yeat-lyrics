I got diamonds from my head to my toes
We can take the plane, where you wanna go?
I just fucked a baddie
She just called me zaddy
Up all night on Addy




Yeah, she eat me up like candy
Yeah, she just got a cavity
But that shot, just called my caddy
Yeah, I watched her turn to a tragedy
Ain't no taking me to the valley
Yeah, you so good with the chemistry
Yeah, we fucked till the sun came up
We was out on the balcony
She love me, she eat it, we lose
Yeah, she donate her mouth to me
I told you, keep it hush with 'em


Like I'm no turning back, but best believe it ain't no trust in 'em
These kids is lame, they fake
The valet tried to take a pic inside the coupe
I just wake up and get this bread like everyday, that's what I do
I went and copped me the C8
Them butterflies, they watched him flew
Withdrawal got me sicker than COVID, yeah I got the Perky flu




You live with your mommy, boy you got a curfew
Yeah, I done copped the crib in the Hills just for the view


They just watching what I do, ye
I just bullet-proofed the coupe
I could do whatever I wanna do
I would go shop to get the coupe
I done lost my mind in this coupe
I done told 'em the truth off the juice
I done talked on this beat for you
I don't give a fuck I just be high, I break every rule
Can assume, I sent Za' everywhere besides the moon
Now you turned your back on me, don't look at me like, "What's the move?"
'Cause if you ask me, I'd tell you to put that gun to your mouth and press shoot
And at the end of the day I never been pressed about you






I got diamonds from my head to my toes
We can take the plane, where you wanna go?
I just fucked a baddie

Yeah, she eat me up like candy
