I've been on molly for weeks
Got a bitch, gon' come that way
Need me a Patek Philippe
Just so I know that I made it
I'm happy, I'm falling asleep
'Cause of the- 'Cause of the money I'm makin'
Fuck it, crash the whip (Yeah, yeah), crash the whip
Big body Benz, it beep (Beep)
Fuck it, now I'm gettin' you wet
I don't want criticism, don't need a peer
Eatin' that pussy, I go for a year
Sip on the lean, sip on no beer
And the gas that I'm smokin', it's from Mars, it's not here
I'm so high, how could I steer?
Shootin' a deer like Johnny, yeah (Yeah)
In the red house, trap dirt, yeah
I hit track, bae
The money, it's fast, it's faster
I know that she hate me (Hate me)
She call me, she wanna have my babies
Got some hoes, you can't ever play me (No no)

Rudin' 'round, 'round in that bih', yeah

I been fed up 'cause I'm weak
Too many sandy cheeks at the beach (Yeah)
On the road, she on littering
I just went double cup the smithereens
Yeah, I'm fresh, I feel like Listerine
With a Palm Angels jacket, baguette on my ring, yeah
Vroom, run it- run it up like I play for the Bucks (Skrrt)
I'm goin' up, I don't really need no love (No)
Be on my team, my ring, my mothafuckin' scene (It's a scene, it's a scene, yeah)
Take an Oxy and I go in, a million years (Yeah)
I done just hopped in the coupe, I'm goin' fast (Skrrt, skrrt)
It's a language, it's fluent, I'm talkin' 'bout cash (Oh, yeah)
I just spent like seven on some RAFs (God damn)
