Yeah, I don't know
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (GOONTEX)


Bitch, I'm on that X, I'm out in space
Eight AM, I took another one, can't feel my face
Can't be in the stu' with no thotties, yeah, can't be in the stu' with no Jakes
My money acrobat, I flip it twenty ways
The devil told me my time was ticking, I got like thirty days
Tell that boy I'm up, on my mama, told me that was disgrace
Pull up matte black, windows tinted, I can race
Way I make these hits and make this money, keep up the pace
Swerving, dodging, oppies, coppers
Pulled up in this matte black, chopper hеlicopter
I just called Izaya, I told him we flying privatе jets




If you my twizzy, you for lifer, my twizzy, my twin


I go in, you go crazy, it's just like it's 6AM
I tried to quit them Percs with Kratom but that ain't do me bad
Every song I got a new flow, they can't even steal that shit
Lil' boy made a hundred songs, they all sound same as shit
Bonkers, yeah, bonkers
I was in that widebody, that Tonka truck, Tonkers
Can't even ask them why they not as fresh as us
Pulled up in that kitted out lil' Bentley truck
I be so damn paranoid, I don't need nothing next to me
It's 8 AM, I'm making this hit, this shit a recipe
Yeah, I told my bitch I feel her but I could barely feel a thing
I told my bitch I see her but I could barely see
I'm for real a geeker, l geek like every week
I ain't caught no sleep in days, I ain't had a break
I could ship you Za' and get you lows or I could ship you shake
I'm high in the stu', I ain't go to sleep so this a wake and hit (I ain't even made it yet)
Take these Percs, they blue like Sonic
Audemars with the baguettes on it
Take these Ecstasy so I don't really have to go and stress on it
They say, "When you go up, just remember me," go put your bless on it
I don't play no games no more, I'm not been playing no chess on it (GOONTEX)
Yeah, I can't play no, yeah


Bitch I'm on that X, I'm out in space
Eight AM, I took another one, can't feel my face
Can't be in the stu' with no thotties, yeah, can't be in the stu' with no Jakes
My money acrobat, I flip it twenty ways
The devil told me my time was ticking, I got like thirty days
Tell that boy I'm up, on my mama, told me that was disgrace
Pull up matte black, windows tinted, I can race
Way I make these hits and make this money, keep up the pace
Swerving, dodging, oppies, coppers
Pulled up in this matte black, chopper helicopter
I just called Izaya, I told him we flying private jets




If you my twizzy, you for lifer, my twizzy, my twin



On this beat, I ain't even rapping, I just told you what I did this morning
No, they ain't gon' ignore it
I'm just rich
