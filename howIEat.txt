Hannah Montana, I'm Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, I'm Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, I'm Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, I'm Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, I'm Hannah Montana, no, no, no


They searching for evil I see
Uh, I'm digging this beat
They asking me how do I eat
This is my business, be
I feel like I'm living a dream 'cause I put the Molly inside of the lean
I;m-I'm high as fuck to be honest
I think I just climbed a mountain, high as can be
Once you can hear what I'm saying, you know that it's really me
The real me don't speak
The hill that I'm on is steep
Yes, I've been up for a week, can't sleep
Get on the phone, watch how I speak
Got red and blue lights behind me



, I speed
Adios, let's go, yeah yeah, 
Ha, ha, ha!


Wrist on freezing, wrist on freezing
Wrist on freezing, my wrist, yeah, I freeze
Money come and go, money come and go
Gotta choose a chest, check it in and out the door
I got big, big, big cash, where'd it go
I got big, big racks, stash, where it at
I got big, big, big bitch, ass fat
If she a thick, thick rich bitch, send that @
Hold on, I got rich quick, Jimmy Neutron, gotta blast




Hold on, what's the issue, bitch? Yeah, hold on, got attached
Coming in and out the ear, yeah, all I speak is facts
I go in and out her rear, all I hear is splash
Fresh, oh, she wan' fuck with a soapie?
Oh, she wan' smoke on this dopie?
Oh, she wan' feel like the Popie?
I'm using the force, they calling me Obi




I shoot at my fours, I feel like I'm Kobe




Oh, she like my words, she wanted some piping?
The weed that I smoke, it's some fruit, yeah it's ripey
The way that I move on this beat, I'm sliding
It missing, and you slipping
Yeah, you a hippie
Where's the bitch at, I don't gotta know
She was with me, she would tip me
Wait, that ass big, are you kidding me?
I make bitches blink out, are you kidding me?
You can talk to my ding-a-ling while I'm sing-a-ling
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, that hoe, send me help
I been through hell, boy can't you tell?
Lean got me like snail, red like me [?]
Promise I don't ever tell, mama I would never fail




They searching for evil I see
