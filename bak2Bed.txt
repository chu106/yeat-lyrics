(Ayy, Mino, is this catchy?)
Ooh, ooh
Had to go wake up (Sleep)
I'ma geek, geek for breakfast (Breakfast)




Yeah, I came in this shit, but I can't take a exit (Swerve)


And I'm booted off the Ecstacy, let's go
I don't drink no Hennessy, no
Yeah, tripled up my cup, I'm like the Embassy
I just woke up to some bullshit, I went back to bed (Bullshit)
When I woke back up, I'm cool, shit, that nasty head
Fell asleep, I was in the pool, woke up in a fancy bed (Fancy)
Ninety milligrams of Oxy', I'm the Walking Dead (Ninety)
I'm not broke, don't watch no pockets, no, I'm not no fed (Shh)




Sipping on Hi-Tech, I'm sipping red



Â (Red, let's go)
And lately I've been acting dead (Funeral)
I do not care, I leave everyone on read
Boot up off these drugs, boot up off this, how I activate
Make a band every day for a month, that's up to thirty K (Thirty)




I can't even put it in my cup, my bro got dirty K's (Buh-buh-buh)
Still on them dirty drugs, I'm in my dirty ways
Y'all been flocking like a bird, y'all act like thirty jays (Brr)
I crashed the whip, I was nodding off, got court in sixty days (Woo!)


How the fuck, how the fuck, how the fuck is I'm paid? (Rich)
Been through so much dumb shit, I had to numb my pain




I don't copy nobody wave, I just remain the same (Hell no)
Bitch, this Corvette way too fast, I switch like eighty lanes (Skrr, skrr)
Finnessing kids out like ten bands, I swerve like eighty lames
I be so high it don't even make sense, I feel like eighty cranes (Brr)
Brand new Maison Margiela shoes got eighty paints (Margiela)
I ship this gas out every day, my stank on eighty planes
Yeah, twizzy serving chicken like he work at Canes (Chickens)
No, bitch, don't play the victim, I don't play that game
Bought that Chrome Hearts, real diamond silver plated ring
I'm a alien, not from here, I feel like a Teletubby thing (Yeah, yeah)




Crazy Cayenne, you could tell that shit was dink (Yeah, yeah)
This a real rabbit, you could tell my coat is mink (Oh yeah, yeah)
No, I don't fuck with nobody 'cause my shit is too unique (Yeah, yeah)
My money tall, my money strong, your money weak (Money weak, yeah)


And I'm booted off the Ecstacy (Let's go)
I don't drink no Hennessy, no
Yeah, tripled up my cup, I'm like the Embassy (Black)
I just woke up to some bullshit, I went back to bed (Bullshit)
Man, they see me on the TV like I'm NBC
Fell asleep, I was in the pool, woke up in a fancy bed (Yeah)




Ninety milligrams of Oxy', I'm the Walking Dead (Uh)
I'm not broke, don't watch no pockets, no, I'm not no fed (Shush)
Sipping on Hi-Tech, I'm sipping red, (Red, let's go)
And lately I've been acting dead (Funeral)
Yeah, I do not care, I leave everyone on read
Boot up off these drugs, boot up off this, how I activate
Make a band every day for a month, that's up to thirty K (Thirty)
I can't even put it in my cup, my bro got dirty K's (Buh-buh-buh)
Still on them dirty drugs, I'm in my dirty ways
Y'all been flocking like a bird, y'all act like thirty jays (Brr)
I crashed the whip, I was nodding off, got court in sixty days (Woo!)



Woke up to some bullshit, I went back to bed
Woke up to some bullshit, I went back to bed
Woke up to some bullshit, I went back to bed
Woke up to some bullshit, I went back to bed
