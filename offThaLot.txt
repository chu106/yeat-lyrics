Bitch, I'm outside with a whole lotta guap (Yeah, whole lot, damn, TRGC made that?)




I'm in LA where the sun don't stop




Sippin' on le—, whole lotta drop
I took the coupe out that bitch, yeah
I swerved that bitch right off the lot (Huh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I took her shoppin' at Saks (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of my diamonds, they shine, yeah (Huh)
Which one, a boot up or Perc'? (Huh)




I don't know, I can't decide (Huh)
I had a hard time cleanin' my life (Huh)


I put a deuce on his head, yeah
Watch her head go back like Pez, yеah

Feel like a dream every day when I boot off the X, I can't tell you what's real or not, I can't feel it all
When it come to me takin' these drugs, I can do a whole lot with my body, my bitch like a druggie now
She pullin', she pullin', she suckin', she suckin', she gone, she gone, that bitch like an In & Out
You might've just learned who I am, but I really been here, doin' this shit for a minute now, yeah




I just been doin' this shit, thinkin' 'bout everybody (Everybody)
I don't be doin' this shit for nobody, don't care about it (I don't care about it)




These lil' kids act like a fruit, like a bitch, he act like a pear about it (Pear)
Yeah, all these dudes copy my shit, they act like some parrots 'bout it (Parrots)




They said that they hard as it gets, well I'm askin' they parents 'bout it (Yeah, yeah)
