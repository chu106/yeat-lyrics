I just pulled out the Lamb', yeah
I got a slatt like him, yeah
I'm on the side of the Benz
Don't put up with molly, I poured up this lean, yeah
I do this, yeah, huh, I do this, haha, yeah, yeah
I'm on the X, I be zooted, yeah (Uh)
I'm on the Perc', I be fooded, yeah
Hop out the four-door, I swerve, swerve (Woo)
I'm in the sky, I'm a bird, bird
My twizzy sliming, they birds, lurk (Bop)
Yeah, told her, "Let's get it" (Get it)
I've been up inside that Tonk', yeah




Who decided you could talk? Yeah
I been chillin' at the top, yeah
My wrist so heavy, it's a mop (Lil' moppy)
I just called up my lil' demon, he told me to take every Perc' 'til it's gone (Boot)




I just woke up, take a X for the boot up




Out my mind, bitch, I'm feeling like Buddha (Out my mind)




Blicky hammer, got to send me a photo (Baow)
Stilpane, pour the eight in my soda (Uh, uh)

[Refrain: Lil Uzi Vert]
I've been countin' racks ever since 3G
Stackin' them rackies up, stand like three feet (Racks)
Yeah, Mike Jackson, hee-hee (Yeah)




My boys, they trappin', they sellin' it
Hitting the block, it go hee-hee (Oh, my God)
