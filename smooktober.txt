Phew, phew (Woo), yeah (Yeah)
I feel the crank comin' on, lil' bitch, it's burnin' (Ooh, ooh)
My wifey say she love me, I bought her a Birkin (Woo, phew)
It's simple to get like this, you just don't deserve it (Uh-uh)
I fucked the whole game up, bitch, I'm Sunday service (Phew)
They asked why I crashed the Benz, I don't give no purpose (Skrrt, ooh-ooh)
I been takin' the Perc' for anxiety, but I don't get nervous



 (Woo, ha, ha), yeah
They be high talkin' crazy, look, they don't really got couragе (Phew, ooh)
At the top of the basеment broke as hell, I was eating on porridge (Woo, yeah)
I done poured a deuce of that Wock' and a line of flourish (Ooh)
You could tell they don't really got money, could tell they malnourished (Woo, yeah)
I don't even flex a lot, but when I do, got peoples embarrassed (Woo, yeah)
Tapped in with the fashion, pulled up on Virgil outside in Paris (Ooh, ooh)




I'm knowing this album 'bout to go platinum, put it on my parents (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)




I don't got time to be shit talkin', you could speak to the carats (No way)




They watching everything I do, repeat it like parrots



 (Phew, brr)
And to be honest, they can't even do it like me, so I could care less (Ooh)


Half a Perc' mixed with a bean, bitch, I could feel this
I told the dealership I'm a star, put it in the ceilings




I just went up (Ah, ah), up
I just went up, up (Ah), and it's stuck (Ah)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve
Yeah, I been high as the birds, birds, birds, birds, birds
I got a twin on the way and he lurk, lurk, lurk, lurk, lurk (Brr, brr)
I just pulled up on the side and I swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (Skrrt)
I really went to the crank and it hurt, it burnt, I learnt, I did it again, bitch, it's my turn (Uh-huh)
We see you sitting 'round the place, we lurking, yeah, we hit you up, and left your ass nourished
I just be taking that X with the Perc' and they know that for sure that I'm leaving the earth
I just keep doing what I'm doing, no, I don't listen to shit, lil' bitch, I don't learn



Phew, phew (Woo), yeah (Yeah)
I feel the crank comin' on, lil' bitch, it's burnin' (Ooh, ooh)
