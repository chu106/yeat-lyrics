Weed limousine (Weed limousine)
Got that purple drink (Got that purple drink)
See my diamonds yea they ice cream (Ice, ice, ice)
On my team you, you gon face the beam (Beam, beam, beam)
Hold up, hey, hold up, hold up


Alexander McQueen, put that on my jeans (Jeans, jeans, jeans)
Different colored drink, that's in my lean (Lean, lean, drink)
Perc, lean, weed, Xan, bitch, watchu need (Yeah)


I swear to God I'm so cold, I can't love her body
I pour a four 'cause I can't really trust nobody
I keep the pack and a beam 'cause yeah, that shit a hobby
Yeah she see the chain and she be screaming "ladee-dee-dadee"
Now they welcome me inside the motherfucking party
My party, it's in the back of the Benz, on her body
Fucking that bitch 'til she screaming out "ladee-dee-dadee"
Weed, lean, limousine, purple drink, diamonds ice cream
With my team, face the beam-I get the pack, for free
I know they hating on me, 'cause I know they jealous of me
I pull up on them in a year in a brand new Maserati
My Gucci bag is on fleek, three bitches different, this week
I swear to god they can't breathe, all of you pussies is sleep
I get the diamonds in my sleep because I know that this shit weak
All of you hungry, can't eat, I'm a dog, take out the leash
All of you broke, you can't feast, I do this shit at the least
