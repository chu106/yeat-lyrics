Turn that shit up, 2


(Let's go) Everything way too flawless (Flawless)
They say "Hey, how much you want?" Yeah, I want all of it (All it)
I already told you to stop hitting my phones up, why you calling?
No, I ain't leaving the stu', I been making these hits, go to sleep in the morning
Think that a G.O.A.T., like me extinct, these kids so boring
Yeah, I wake up on the E, I can hear 'em snoring
I went and fucked my money up, I was horny
Y'all music on some Thanksgiving dinner, shit was corny


Racks on me, yeah, what? (Money, yeah)
I was lovin' that, I was lovin' that, I was lovin' that slut, slut (Woo)
Yeah, ah, ah, I was deep in her gut, yeah (Woo)
High in the sky, high in the sky like I'm Budden (Ah-ah)


All that broke shit is dead
All of thеse diamonds is VS1, these bitchеs a sled




I really love to take all these drugs, I'm sipping red right now




Bitch told me I'ma die, told her, " I don't care," but I'm good though
Y'all not, y'all on that dog food, that good dope
I remember when I didn't care, in case it's something up, I keep it extended
All they shit is trash, the car they got is rented
All these kids is wack, they just do what the fuck is trendy
Yeah (Let's go), and I guess right now, that's me
For a year straight, every week I heard a new kid soundin' like me
Yeah, that shit was bad, you know I wasn't lying
Takin' a Perc' before brushing my teeth




This is the first time I slept this week
I'm feeling blessed like I just sneezed
Vibed out-ah, we been riding around
Don't test me, I always hold my ground
They say "Yeat, why the fuck is you growling?"
'Cause I'm high, and that mean that I'm falling down from it




I'll leave you traumatized (Yeah)
And I'm still in this thang (Yeah)
I changed my style so much (Yeah)
Yeah
