(Yo Luca, where you at?)
Ooh-ooh


Every Sunday, we hit Chanel (Yeah)




Yeah, they called me up and told me they have nothing left to sell me
I’ve been off the X because already back to the how it would feel (Yeah)
I stay out the way 'cause nine of ten out of y'all would tell (Tell)
Me and one my brother's life at risk, I don’t know how to spell



 (Shh)
This lifestyle either a blessing or a curse, I really can’t tell (Yeah)
You ignoring me 'fore I came up, yeah, but imagine if I was in jail
They love to ask for a lot, but they'd go ghost if I ask for help (Go)


Yeah, I can’t rely on nobody, I gotta go do that shit myself (Myself)
Flawless stones swimmin', mini Michael Phelps (Water)
I don't give a fuck bout nothing, y’all review everything like it’s Yelp (Yeah)
Had to hit the gas and make a left, they was on my tail
She got expensive taste, shrimp and steak, and they cut the tail
Told 'em fuck a wave, you can set sail
You ain’t getting paid and I can tell (Broke)
Man you just a jake, you probably smell (You probably stink)
I seen that broke ass motherfucker trying to say his Chrome Hearts pants cost $2450 (Lil' broke ass)




I ain’t going for none of that shit, you know where I stay, you gon’ have to kill me (Phew)
I pull up and beat her ass from the back, yeah, filthy (Yeah)
She love drinking the nut, she said it’s her favorite meal (Yeah)
Her first favorite meal is eating the real deal (Of course)




You don't even got it, trust me, I know when somebody real (Yeah)
Been through a lot, I’ve seen a lot, I know the spiel (Yeah)
This Undercover hoodie, it still match my Amiri's, they gray with a hint of teal
Double match the coupe, my daily vision was real (Swerve)
I done seen some riches before and that shit is way too real (Yeah)
This ecstasy told my heart to stop, I told it chill
They askin' why I ever won't quit, but I told 'em I wouldn’t be able to feel
I was tryna see what’s over that mountain, what's over that hill, it's gon' get me killed and it give me chills
You couldn't sign for real
Our label done fucked up for lettin' me out my deal
