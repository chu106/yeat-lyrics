Fell asleep on the yacht (Damn, Trgc made that?)
Pointers in the watch
Called up Eliantte, said I need the baguettes to rock




You be tripping, you be smoking the crack, you be smoking the rock
Yeah, I been shipping it out for months, I been shipping the Za'
Chane'-ne' on the tag of the bed, I figured it out




I done leveled up, I put pointers in my ring
I done leveled up, I'm at the store, I'm at Celine




Your bitch be choosing behind your back, she said she wanted me
Three hundred sixty five bands in a year
Took the, took the C63 Benz, I'm outta here
Busted a nut on her face, and some got in her hair
Mix the X with the Perc', that's a perfect pair




I be high, LV sunglass on my face so they don't stare




What's the point of getting high if you don't ever care
I'm with your thottie from the back, I'm in her derriere






Boot up (Woo)
Boot up (Woo)
Choose up (Woo)
I got my shoe off (Woo)


On the top
Her top the best, I told that bitch, "No, please don't stop" (Yeah, keep going)
I was out a year 'fore I signed a deal, I made a lot




They be capping in they raps, they live a lie
I had too many close calls, I almost died
They ask me, "Why do you live like that?"
Why would you ask me if I would split the bag
You a cop to me bitch, yeah, a track
Yeah, I'm richer than all of y'all and it's just a fact
You and your baby mama, yeah, done went out sad
You so scared the way you living, boy, you can't even step outside
Yeah, all my diamonds flawless, all no SI




And my twizzy down the way gon' get you spilled, boy, if you ****
