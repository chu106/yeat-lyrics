Let's go






Perfect, rockin' a turban (Oh yeah, oh yeah)




Sippin' on mud but this bitch like bourbon (Dirty, dirty)




I took the coupe out the lot, bitch, I'm thinkin' 'bout swervin', yeah




I'm 'bout to sign for a lot 'cause this shit ain't urgent (Okay)




I got a whole lot of money comin' in (All day)




They told me it's a couple thots waiting outside, told 'em, "Bring 'em in" (Okay)




She said that she wanna come pull up and suck on my cock, told her, "Drink my kids"
I knew all this shit from the start, so I already told you what it all is
Oh my, oh my gosh, oh my goodness, ah






I already did what I can (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
I'm 'bout to do it again (I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)
It's her move, it's her move (I'm on, I'm on)


Got off the phone with my twizzy



, we ran it up, yeah, we was just doubled up
I call my bitch and she pull up and lick it up, yeah, she's a slut, slut, slut




I had to build this shit up from the bottom, I told her that shit not enough
Every time they wanna lie about it, I'ma ask 'em 'bout it 'cause they bluff


Ran it up, we so up, we so up, up, up, up, up




Woah-woah, woah, we so up, up, up, up, up
Woah-woah, up, woah, up, woah-woah, up




Woah, uppy, woah, woah-woah, uppy






Ran this shit up from the bottom, I knew I was gon' go
Tonka truck



, I'm 'bout to hop in a Ghost




Told 'em I needed that money to pay all my bros, you ain't even close to us




Told 'em it is how it is, that's how this shit goes
I wrapped my money up, this shit look like a turban




My diamonds flawlessed off, I said these bitches surfing




Yeah, I'm sipping on this mud, it's dirty, it look like bourbon




Yeah, she text me what I'm doing, I told her I'm busy swerving




Yeah, I got a lot to do, it ain't easy being this perfect




Perfect, rockin' a turban (Oh yeah, oh yeah)




Sippin' on mud but this bitch like bourbon (Dirty, dirty)




I took the coupe out the lot, bitch, I'm thinkin' 'bout swervin', yeah
