I think it's too late
They be getting high, I be livin' high
Bullets fly to the wind, hit it to your top
But you dont listen to people who get high to


They be getting high, I've been living high
I see my life flash in the corner of my eye
When you— When you wake up, got to boot up with me, got to match my high
Rock Chanel, yeah, Chane'-ne' with the Chrome Heart on my eye
Yeah, y'all gon' rock Marc Jacobs, I'm gon' rock Margelly




Got a stomach ache, I rub the hunnids on my belly




If you do me wrong, don’t matter who you is, bitch, I’ll turn to Mеlly
Couple months ago, was shipping Za' then shit got sticky, shit got smelly
Yеah, canary yellow diamonds, pissed on 'em like R. Kelly




This whole lifestyle ain't cheap, I wanna know who told you that
I be dead like a mummy, I still won't go for that


I bought the Trackhawk, just to see two hundred on the dash
Did a lot of wrong inside my life but I don't have no regrets
I leveled up, I bought the Cayenne and bought the jet
I don't give no fucks 'bout what you talking 'bout, I'm not impressed
And you still live at your mommy's house, I'd be depressed
You can't do shit on your own, like I got to tell you to get dressed
You could choose to live like me and die or live like all the rest
I risked my life a million times for no accomplishments
I just wake up then get high, then get to popping shit
You ain't risk nothing at all, you don't deserve to ball
You don't deserve pointers in the watch, you deserve to trip and fall
I can end the things that let you watch the world with one call
Couple exes, couple haters, know they waiting on me to fall
I'll take every last season



, if I don't got legs, then I'ma crawl
Indepent than you and richer than all of y'all
And my bizzy deserve the world waiting on you to call
I just ripped off all my chains, I had to take it off
I don't got to say shit, I'd rather not say at all
That lil' bullshit y'all be fakin', you got say it all
This shit got you mad but you try to play it off
I'd rather lose every time than not play at all
Didn't I tell you exactly how it was gon' happen, it paid off
Do you want a bad bitch or long money? That's the trade off


Bullets fly to the wind, now its time to see
I be dealin' with my life like you should see
When I hit her from the side, she be like "Yeah that's it"
I rather die than be alive, but I see at all
(Yo, Luca) I think it's too late
They be getting high, I be livin' high
Bullets fly to the wind, hit it to your top
But you dont listen to people who get high to




They been getting high, I've been living high
I see my life flash, in the corner of my eye
When you— When you wake up, got to boot up with me, got to match my high

Yeah, y'all gon' rock Marc Jacobs, I'm gon' rock Margelly
