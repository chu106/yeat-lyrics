Hmm, I'm a businessman, I have myself (Have myself)
Don't know to sing, but I know how you feel
I'm with the belt, the one that's made by Chanel (Double CC)
Don't let me work for you, 'cause I'm gonna take out your client and tell 'em (Mhm-hmm, yeah)
And I know that I end up well
And I know that you goin' out sad, I can tell

I got a whip, it's convertible (Skrrt)
And I'm droppin' your bitch, she a squirtable
Booted up off the drugs, it feel wonderful
Got a whole lotta cash, I got plentyful
How the fuck y'all pussys geek up on Benadryl?
Run to the cash like a muhfuckin' trainer man
I'm higher up, I can show you my pedestal
I ate up this beat just like it's a Lunchable
Live how I want, I don't go by no schedule
I be geeked up for no reason
I'm on the sun and I told 'em it's freezin'
I got some money, some hoes, 
Got a new car, it don't even got keys in
I switch up my sauce like a muhfuckin' seasoning
I was so high, I can't even believe it
I got some questions, I know that I'm leavin'
She doin' me toppy, I know that I need it
My wrist got a watch, yeah, I know that it's leakin'
My bitch got a pussy that I like to sleep in
[?] how I know that you tweakin'
I seen it was comin', I got a lil' 
Fucked up everyday, yeah, you know the feeling
I had to go up 'cause I'm out of the deep end
Why should I go up? I got whole lotta reasons
Coupe got brown litter like a Reese's
I'm breakin' the in little pieces
I'm not lyin' when I say that I'm geekin'
I'm not lyin' when I say that I'm speakin' (Yeah)
I wasn't lyin' when I said the car ain't no keys in it, there's a reason (Skrrt)



Fuck it, I might drop them racks on a Masi'
Pull up on a bitch, sloppy toppy
Fuckin' on niggas hoes, that ain't none new to me
Beat up the block, eat it up like it's food to me
All of you niggas sellin', stay away from me
I been thinkin' too long, fuckin' caught me a felony
Shoot up his block, ain't no cryin', no sympathy
Choppa gon sing, violin, ain't no symphony
I'ma send bullets back if you tryna beef with me
Look at the to me
Bitch after bitch and they tryna get rid of me
Most of these niggas, they owe me like 50B
If a nigga owe, I let off a 50 G's
AK with a drum, I knock off his shoulder
To a hundred, huh? Bitch, ain't no foldin' me
Havin' that drank for the low, ain't no 
Four of the Wock, I ain't sippin' no Hennessy
spin on this block, are you kiddin' me?
Gave her a dose of that dick, shit a dopamine
Beat up that pussy, don't want you, lil' petty bitch
Cash in my pockets, got big racks, fat as shit
UPS , we don't FedEx shit, go
