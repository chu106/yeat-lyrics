Even though I been staying inside
All you need to stay top line
All of my diamonds they SI




I turn the whip in the inside (Foreally)
I put them diamonds on rose gold (Foreally)
You say you got money but no hoes (Foreally)
White diamonds sitting on rose gold (Foreally, foreally)
Yeah, we having the hundons (Foreally, foreally)
In that thing, talkin' mob tie (Foreally)
Sipping the drink, gotta brush off (Foreally)
Everything big, got a franchise (Foreally)
I just went in, turned the bag up
Y'all in the mall going bankrupt (Yeah, foreally)


I count every time I walked in on 'em, richer than 'em, pop my shit
I count every time I take a Perc' like it was yesterday
I count every time I was really broke, I ain't even have food to eat
I count every time I'm sad, it make me happy
I count every time they sleeping on me, swear to God they was napping
All my brothers rich bastards, all we rock Margelly
Flew this bitch from out of state then fucked her in the telly
Yeah, I ain't broke, I ink up daily
Every time they rock them fake ass diamonds, call 'em Cinderelly




Glass, not no S.I., had to tell 'em that we is not friendly
Even if my brother turn his back on me, I'll turn to Melly

Driving in the coupe, I'm going two hundred, fuck a copper
Sipping on this purple in my cup, I'm sipping Wockhardt
