Bitch, I ain't sleep in days
I ain't got a break, yeah, I don't take no breaks
Pushing two hundred in that Jeeper creepers and I ain't hit the brakes
If you wanna live like this, you gotta be flawless, no mistakes
Used to eat them noodles in the basement, now it's steak




Yeah, I be so high, I be forgetting what's at stake
Bitch just pulled up on me, ate my dick, now she want stay




Yeah, flawless all my diamonds, now my wrist turned to a lake
Pour some Wock' up in that pineapple Fanta, sipping Laker




Yeah, they really on they last breath, they on they stimulator
I just bought the M3
It got turbo on it and them red seats




Yeah, and if we being honest, they ain't high as me
Yeah, money, sex, and drugs, bitch, that's all I need
I be high flying with my doves, where my birdies be, yeah


All in, understand me, yeah
Chanel sunglasses on, can't tell if I'm geeked or not, yeah
I been booted up off the drugs for a whole year, I'm a full-time astronaut
Nobody care about what you said, don't matter if we asked or not
I spent six hundred thousand on this car, bitch, this bitch an Aston Martin
And I bought the Maybach not to drive it
Yeah, Number (N)ine with a Issey Miyake bag with the strap on it
Louis duffle bag, whole lotta cash, whole lotta racks on it
Virgil called me up and told he got me with the season drop
Bitch, I woke up at eight PM and fell asleep at twelve o'clock
All my money fat, this bitch got Lizzo




Put on for my twizzies, gave 'em all hope (Damn, Trgc made that?)
Swerved off the road, took the exit, the next one
Trust me, I'm ahead 'em all
I'm playing the PS6 and they on the PS1
Mini Draco give 'em cancer
I don't ever answer answers
Yeah, money twerking like a dancer
I been on the bed, finna boot it up on X
A hour ago, I was booted off the X in my chest, yeah
Now I took that Perc', I been nodding off, dont know if itâ€™s the best
Why you lying about them drugs? Nobody cares, nobody impressed
'Cause I wish I never tried 'em to be honest but I'm still blessed


Bitch, I ain't sleep in days
I ain't got a break, yeah, I don't take no breaks
Pushing two hundred in that Jeeper creepers and I ain't hit the brakes
If you wanna live like this, you gotta be flawless, no mistakes
Used to eat them noodles in the basement, now it's steak
Yeah, I be so high, I be forgetting what's at stake
Bitch just pulled up on me, ate my dick, now she want stay
Yeah, flawless all my diamonds, now my wrist turned to a lake
Pour some Wock' up in that pineapple Fanta, sipping Laker
Yeah, they really on they last breath, they on they stimulator
