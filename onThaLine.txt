Stuck in the mix, mix pills, yeah, 'cause I love it (Phew, yeah)
Forty-five seconds, you in and you out for a dozen (Phew)
Yeah, and it's way too far gone to save that shit, I won't touch it (Yeah)
Back of a shotgun barrel kick back like buckets




Snappin' the fakes in my circle like Kit-Kat does it




I could take your lil' bitch if I want to, yeah, but I doesn't (But I doesn't, hey)

They ask how the hell I make money, I couldn't еven tell 'em 'causе I don't know how (Ah)




Turn up that beat 'til it's blazin', yeah, turn up the beat 'til it bounce (Yeah)
I'm too far gone, couldn't save that shit, so I'm Perc'ed out, yeah, on the couch (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can't even rock with you, you not a boss (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I'm gon' rock out at every show (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
