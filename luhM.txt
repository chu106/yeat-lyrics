Yeah, bitch, I touched an M


Bitch, I touched an M, bitch, I touched an M (A lil' M)




No, I'm not your twizz, no, I'm not your friend




I see shit from a new vision, got a different lens
I might never get to swerve on the cops (Skrrt)
Yeah, I swerved the Lamb', bitch, I turned it to a chop (Lil' chop)
I touched an M, then I made it to the top (Skrrt)
Rock Chane'-ne' and some Gucci on my socks (Skrrt, in the cut)

Bitch, your money midget, my money tall as shit (Uh)
Pullin' up on exes, bitch, it's time to flex (Uh, uh)
You say that you crazy, bitch, I'm crazy too (Damn)

Bitch, my money funny (Skrrt)
Fucked my money up so much, it told me that it's cumming

All my diamonds flawless (Skrrt), these baguettes don't make mistakes (Skrrt)
I don't know nobody, ain't no slices in this cake, huh
All these kids got lazy, my money stayed in shape
I'm just stayin' to myself, bitch, I can't trust no jake
All my pockets got too swollen, had to buy a safe
I put the devil on my music, he told me I'm the best
I don't care about making friends, I just care about faith
Yeah, bitch, I'm on the edge and this shit feel great


Bitch, I touched an M, bitch, I touched an M (A lil' M)
