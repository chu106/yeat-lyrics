Ayy, it's all up to me
It's all up to me, ayy




Oh, ayy, hey


(It's all up to me, it's all up to me) Hey
First time touchin’ a mil', life never felt so real (Real)
They tryna be my twizzy, you already know ain't no deal (Whole 'lotta cash)
You sipping on lil' stretched Wock', bitch, I'm just cracking the seal




Gotta pay for a good ass lawyer, we ain’t sittin' in no cell
I was just out in La Jolla



, I was just shipping some bails




Diamonds on big boy water, got these bitches straight out the well
I've tried replacing the X with the Percs but bitch, you don't know how that feel






I just try keeping it real but I'm always gon' keep it a hundred
My bitch did a brand new favor, she just bе drinking my nut
I always gotta dodge all the hate, I gotta dodgе the assumptions




How you gon' turn to a snitch? Yeah, how you talk shit but you runnin'?
I used to be eating noodle-oodles sittin' in the basement with the roaches in it
They used to not fuck with the kid, now I'm going up, everybody in my business




Said you can't trust me, lil' bitch, I'm a snake, go behind your back and stab it
You know it's not shit to go pull out the Wraith, bring it out in automatic
I OD on the pills so much, I hired a full-time medic




Pull up on my bitch and she eat me like lunch, said I got rid of her headache
I could tell real from the fake, we just be having abundance




Signing the deal, would you be on my faith? I got my money out of nothing
VS1 flawless, all of 'em shine




Yeah, told you stop hitting my phone, told you stop wasting my time




I got a big ol' bitch, she got a big behind
I just been sending them packs, I just been making them fly
I can't go back on my word, I already said that it's time
All of my twizzies is up, bitch, we been next in line




And these Yercs, they got me moody, yeah, y'all federal




You don't got no money but you judging, call you Judy





(It's all up to me, it's all up to me) Hey
First time I talked to the mll',



 life never felt so real
They tryna be my twizzy



, you already knowing the deal
You sipping on lil' stretched Wock', bitch, I'm just cracking the seal
Gotta pay for a good ass lawyer, we ain’t sittin' in no cell
I was just out in La Jolla, I was just shipping some bails
Diamonds on big boy water, got these bitches straight out the well
I've tried replacing the X with the Percs but bitch, you don't know how that feel
