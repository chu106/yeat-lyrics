Woke up
I just woke up to a bag
I just woke up
Hey


Whole lotta money coming in, I'm just a kid, I don't know how to act
When I wake up, it don't surprise me how most these bitches act
Nine of ten of y'all don't be as high as me, that's just a simple fact
GLE came in, got the Carfax
Heard you wanted to make a song with me, getting Turbo-taxed
I was sipping exotic and getting wax'
Ain't gon' lie, I was in the basement, now I'm in a jet


What they said?
Yeah, what they said about us, probably left 'em on read
Yeah, new coupe got new insides, this bitch all-red
Yeah, in this Maybach, put the curtains down, I'm getting head
Sad, yeah, oh, he went out sad
Yeah, everything flawless on us, you know it's on us
We sip a whole lot of motherfucking Wock', bitch, we keep that right on us
I was lazy as hell, I Uber Eat-ed two cups
Say you 7/11 soda from exotic pop
Yeah, geeked up 24/7, bitch, I'm out my body a lot
Ecstasy, Oxycodone, codeine breakfast
Yeah, that bitch's throat the GOAT, I got her diamond necklace
I only be with her one day of the week
And more, she gon' suck me up in my sleep
Sometimes I be so high, I can't even see
It's all bullshit they talking 'bout, bitch just let me be
