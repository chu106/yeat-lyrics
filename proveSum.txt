Yeah, I called up Eliantte, said I need the baguettes in the Cuban
Yeah, you talk a whole lot about making that money, boy, you need to prove it


All of my clothes come from Italy, all of my bitches be missing me
Yeah, went and got paid, made a new wave, the rest all history
That lil' ass band you made ain’t shit to me
Me and that bitch done had an epiphany
Why the fuck that bitch sniffing on Tiffany?
I boot off the X 'cause it give me abilities
I know he broke, no, it's no tricking me
Lil' shawty gon' pull up and get straight to that licking me
Five hundred for the Chromе Hearts tee, tucked about ten for thе jeans
Yeah, I fell in love with the bean, I got the best and it's no in between


Yeah, bitch gon make her tweak, I'm hittin' Bergdorf every week
Hop out the Maybach, just had a seat massaging me
When I wake up, I'ma take a Perc' before I brush my teeth
But they all diamond now, yeah, so I guess I’m flossing creeks
My diamonds wet, they crying
Them diamonds SI, they not hitting for shit, nobody seeing them shine
I just wake up and get high, I don't even think about trying
My money stand tall, it's so high, why would I think about signing?
Y'all follow the leader, the Simon, Wock' by the liter, four lines
I popped a boot up, I live in the clouds, yeah, I'm in the sky
I heard they put you on life support 'cause your money was so weak
Yeah, I bought the Maybach to get top in it and put the seat down
Yeah, all of my money so up, it's Rick on my feet now
When that bitch pull up, it's WWE, finna beat down, yeah

Dumping that bitch from the throat, from the neck up, yeah, 'cause that bitch throat the GOAT
