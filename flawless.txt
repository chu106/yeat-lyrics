You don't exist
Take a Perc' in the Tonka, that's it




Money swollen like cyst, huh




They done put faith in the kid, huh




Got a Bentley Mulsanne in my hangar




The big body peel off the road, watch it spin (Woo)
I'm the one, got a million dollars
I doubled that shit, then I tripled again




Flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless, yeah
Flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless, yeah (Tripled again)
Flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless, yeah (Tripled again)
Flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless, yeah (Tripled again)
