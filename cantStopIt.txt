Bag after bag, after bag, I can't stop
Yerc after Perc', after Yerc, I can't stop
Hopped inside the Cayenne, boot it up and then I fly
On the phone with my demon, we build it up and then retire




Toxic, toxic, yeah, came in that building with fires
Walk on the muhfuckin' ceiling, I'm bootin' up everyday, everything fly
Yeah, they gon' copy my trend, they gon' copy my sound, they gon' copy the guy




Always gon' get me more money, more money, more monеy, more money, don't die on mе


I bought a crib in the sky (Yeah, yeah)
Twenty-four seven, this bitch 'bout to die (Yeah, yeah, die)
Takin' the yanky, more janky, more banky




I run up this bitch like a big ol' tanky
The big body whip, 'bout to pull out the big body
Swerve on the side, 'bout to pull up, do cranky (Do cranky, ha-ha-ha)
I'm gonna pull up, the tanky
I got the big ol' whip, got a big ol' Glock, got the big ol' stick with a binkie (What? Shh)




You gon' get whacked, you gon' get whacked like a spanking (Mm-hm)




I been swervin' off the Earth




Diamonds in my pinkie, yeah, the diamonds on my hair




Don't know why I did this shit, just heard it and I do it




I don't like all that talkin' back and forth, just keep it mur—
Bye-bye (Phew), huh, fuck it, swerve
Yeah, I learned my lesson, for these jakes, I say they shworms
Thought they was gon get eat up like a fish, get eat by worm




R.I.P. to the dumbass kid, gon' try geeked up on syrup






Bag after bag, after bag, I can't stop
Yerc after Perc', after Yerc, I can't stop
Hopped inside the Cayenne, boot it up and then I fly
On the phone with my demon, we build it up and then retire




Toxic, toxic, yeah, came in that building with fires
Walk on the muhfuckin' ceiling, I'm bootin' up everyday, everything fly
Yeah, they gon' copy my trend, they gon' copy my sound, they gon' copy the guy




Always gon' get me more money, more money, more money, more money, don't die on me
