My bitch, she rock Alyx, she a mountain climber
My bitch, she rock Alyx


My bitch, she rock Alyx, she a mountain climber
I rock a ice pick, I'm a mountain climber
All this ice on me, I'm a mountain climber
I get high as God, I'm a mountain climber
Yeah, yeah, baby, she a bad, bad lady
I been high as God lately, switch and crashed dummies, baby
Yeah, crash dummies, boo, I'm high as fuck, I'm booted up
I crashed the Mercedes, CLA AMG, the latest
I was jumping on a bed in the hotel
I smacked lil' shawty ass, it's redder than Ro-Tel




Yeah, get that boy a snippet, cut the whole tail
Lil' boy dead so I guess it didn't go well


Yeah, she pull up and play the flute, she ate my semen, oh
Boy, I'm not your twin,Â I'm not your kid, I'm not your cuddy




This Trackhawk got seven hundred and seven horses in it
Got a garage so I can put all of my Porsches in it
Flawless, the coupe, I went and cut the fucking top off
Flawless, these VS1 diamonds, they bust, they top dollar
All of 'em is pussy cats, they can't come for the top dog
I was in the and I left the fucking top down
Now that we the hardest artists, I know they wanna talk now
Now that we got all this bread, they wanna talk down
Bitch I'm on a private jet, I can't even talk now
Bitch I'm so high up, all I can do is talk down
Beam on it, beam on it
I wanna, I wanna, wanna pop a bean
Pull up on me, she on top of me
This shit as easy as a, b, c, yeah, one, two, three
One of my twizzies'll hit they melly up for nothing, for free
Song way too hot, I burn your ears, I gave you fifth degree
I cannot die today or I can die when I turn fifty three
I put this shit on God, bitch this is not no cap, this no kidding
I can see how I'd die 'cause I got beef with one of my kidneys


My bitch, she rock Alyx, she a mountain climber
I rock a ice pick, I'm a mountain climber
All this ice on me, I'm a mountain climber
I get high as God, I'm a mountain climber
Yeah, yeah, baby, she a bad, bad lady
I been high as God lately, switch and crashed dummies, baby
Yeah, crash dummies, boo, I'm high as fuck, I'm booted up
I crashed the Mercedes, CLA AMG, the latest
I was jumping on a bed in the hotel
I smacked lil' shawty ass, it's redder than Ro-Tel




Yeah, get that boy a snippet, cut the whole tail
Lil' boy dead so I guess it didn't go well
