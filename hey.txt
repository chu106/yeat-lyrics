Hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, what's goin' on with you? (Hey)
She call me, she told me to pull up (Pull up, pull up, pull up)
And my people just called me, twin I'm like, "What up?"
Hey, hey, I get bands (Racks, racks)
Hey, hey, I don't want no friends, yeah, hey, switch it back
Hey, hey, I like her to bring it right back, hey, hop out the Cayenne
Hey, hey, bitch, I'm back on the X, yeah, I don't wanna go back
Hey, hey, yeah, my new bitch is lovin' that dick, when shе pull up, I aim where her throat's at
Hеy, hey, got diamonds bright busting out the bitch, yeah, turn up, yeah, where the soap at?
Hey, hey, bitch so wet, when she pull up on me, her pussy be soakin'
Hey, hey, bitch, it's a brand new wave, from the top to the bottom, we gon' bust it open


I had it down on the pills, it was too real, yeah, OD'd on an X and a Perc'
I went and tatted a demon on me then this shit started to happen, this shit start to work




I called my twizzy, he out in a jam, won't ship him the Za', I'ma ship him the work
I pull up, I pull up to Follies, I throw my money then I'm watching it twerk




I pull up, I made a other wave, it was wavy crazy, man I'm watching 'em dance
I pull up, all of my diamonds, they from Eliantte, they from the skirt
Bitch, I just went mixed the X with the Perc' and I boot up
I just took off on the Earth, Earth, Earth
I like that lil' bitch, yeah, she wetty, she pull up on 'em and she surf
Ecstacy and out of the perc'
Hop in that Cayenne, you know that it swerve




I don't give a fuck about money, it burn
I just ran over the curb
I just been doing myself
I don't gotta tell you the word
I'm the one put on the bells
I'll punch your lil' ass off the Earth
