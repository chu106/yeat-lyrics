At least I woke up today




Had to get rich like that, I ain't pick no side (Yeah)
Heard you got skipped like that, get finessed all the time (Ayy)
Blew a dub on a beat, not a quarter, not a dime (No more)
You ain't gettin' nothin' else no more, why you lyin'? (Oh)
How it feel to be rich like this? Yeah, it got me cryin'
Won't talk to the cops, we quiet, yeah, what crime? (Shhh)

She show love to my crotch (Foreally), all the time


I just called my twizz up, told him we got the world (Got the world)

Told you I done turned it up, told you I done turned it up (Really, really)

Pulled up on my shawty, what she did? Drank up all my kids
Bitch, we in NY, as deep as it gets, we chill at the Ritz




I can't make my mind with these drugs, no, I can't pick




Woah, no, don't worry
All my pockets filled up with racks, they so glory
No, baby girl, don't try me, this not Maury




Most y'all lost, find yourself just like you Dory, let's go
