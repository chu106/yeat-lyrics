Oh, ah




I can't change what I said, what I did (Uh, uh)
I feel like I'm runnin' circles 'round this bitch
And when I wake up, opps be callin' my phone just like one of my bitches
One eye open when I sleep alone, can't trust nobody, that's it
Ho, that's it (That's it), I can't trust nobody, that's it
Ho, that's it, I can't trust nobody, that's it
I bought a hotel, can't have this bitch know where the hell I sleep
I don't lose, bitch, I always win, I can't take defeat



 (Go, go)


I've been on drugs for awhile (Go)
I can't seem to figure it out
Got my money up, yeah, so it's fuck 'em (Yeah)
I get deep up in that bitch, pull up, yeah, truck 'em (Yeah)
Huh, I done hit the side on this bitch (Woah, woah, woah)
I can't choose (Can't choosе), I can't decide with thesе bitches
I got blues and clues about ya, can't be silent with a snitch (Shh)
I done stayed down until I got so fuckin' rich (Rich, rich), yeah
They ain't seeing me, I had to relocate
No, this not CDG, this the Homme Plus way
Ho, this ain't CMG, this a GLE
You ain't tell me what you did, tell me what you see
I done switched inside the coupe with the peanut butter seats
I done got my money up and that bring jealousy
How you were rockin' with me, now you're hatin' on me, now you envy me?
And that top tier fuck shit, I don't rock with, keep it away from me


I can't change what I said, what I did (Uh, uh)
I feel like I'm runnin' circles 'round this bitch
And when I wake up, opps be callin' my phone just like one of my bitches
One eye open when I sleep alone, can't trust nobody, that's it
Ho, that's it (That's it), I can't trust nobody, that's it
Ho, that's it, I can't trust nobody, that's it
I bought a hotel, can't have this bitch know where the hell I sleep
I don't lose, bitch, I always win, I can't take defeat (Go, go)


Woo, ah (Go, go)
Woo, ah (Go, go)
