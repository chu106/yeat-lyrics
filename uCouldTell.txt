When you rich like this, it feel great
When you get a lot of shit on your plate
When you get to the top with the dawgs
You get to flex all that shit in their face
You could tell them lil' boys a disgrace
You could tell that we been in first place
You could tell that I go in this Tonka
To hell what I look to, to hell what I chase
I'm just ridin' in the Tonka, bitch, I'm on this shit
You don't know how the fuck it feel to be this fuckin' rich
I just popped a X pill and half my body glitched




I thought everybody stayed the same, everybody fuckin' switched






Had to take a break from X, bitch, I could feel it in my chest




Bitch, I need a Percocet before I start to get upset
We get rowdy, we go crazy, we gon' turn up for that check
Had to go and put some diamonds on my neck so they show me some respect
I said, "Fuck yo Masi', bitch, I'm in a Lamb' truck," yeah
Might go hit my garage and pull out the GLE for fun




We could be shittin' on 'em all day, we do it for fun
They said that they went and touched the moon, I touched the sun




I went and got me the Tonka, that big body, bitch, I bagged back, I went and just ran it up
I don't be savin' my money, I spend it all day, bitch, I made it all back, yeah, I doubled up




Thotty gon' pull up on me, she gon' gulp up my dick like a motherfuckin' 7-Eleven cup




I could keep goin' for days but I just gotta chill just so they think that they close to us
Yeah, turn this shit up, they are not close to us
We some real rockstars, it's a pill, pop all of 'em
I got beef with my kidney, he said that we got a problem




He must've thought that we was kidding, my twizzy pulled up and just popped him
I don't feel the sun, no, not at all




I'm inside my home, I'm turning up but I'm not alone
I just got the Chrome Heart, mixed it up, then sauced it on




My bitch gon' pull up on me, eat my bone, she bite it off


When you rich like this, it feel great
When you get a lot of shit on your plate
When you get to the top with the dawgs
You get to flex all that shit in their face
You could tell them lil' boys a disgrace
You could tell that we been in first place
You could tell that I go in this Tonka
To hell what I look to, to hell what I chase
I'm just ridin' in the Tonka, bitch, I'm on this shit
You don't know how the fuck it feel to be this fuckin' rich
I just popped a X pill and half my body glitched




I thought everybody stayed the same, everybody fuckin' switched
